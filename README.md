## Pre-requisites

* Node - http://nodejs.org/
* Grunt - https://gruntjs.com/

## Install

Clone this repo or download and unzip it.

## Quick Start

**Before continuing**, please edit the `accountName` key to the `package.json` file. For example:

```json
    {
      "name": "vtex-speed",
      "accountName": "your-store-account-name",
    }
```
**Enable/Disable https**, please edit the `secureUrl` key to the `package.json` file. For example:
- **true** - Enable https and use port 443
- **false** - Disable https and use port 80
```json
    {
      "secureUrl": true,
    }
```
**Important**  
- https required disable/ignore warning in brownser.
- Enabling HTTPS automatically disables the livereload - [Read more about this issue](http://livereload.com/limitations/https/).

Enter the folder you cloned or downloaded, install dependencies and run `npm start`:

```shell
    cd speed
    npm install
    npm start
```

First, open your browser here to authenticate:  

http://your-store-account-name.vtexlocal.com.br/admin/Site/Login.aspx

Then, open a normal page, like your home:

http://your-store-account-name.vtexlocal.com.br/?debugcss=true&debugjs=true

**Important**  You should replace `your-store-account-name` with the accountName of your store. Who would guess, huh?


Nice! Live Reload has reloaded that stylesheet for you.

## Features

All files in `src/` are compiled, optimized and copied to `build/` when you run `grunt`.

You can further configure this process editing `Gruntfile.coffee`.

Currently supported:

- LiveReload of assets in HTTP and HTTPS
- Coffee compilation
- LESS compilation
- SASS compilation
- JS and CSS Minification
- Optimize Images
- Create Icons SpriteSheet

Check the `src/` directory for examples.

### Spritesheets

To create spritesheets for your icons by putting your icons png files into the src/sprite directory. Then you can use render your icons by using the class icon-<filename>.

### Pages reverse proxy

You can use VTEX Speed serve HTML pages while developing, simply put your HTML files inside `src/` directory. You can see example page [http://your-store-account-name.vtexlocal.com.br/page-example/](http://your-store-account-name.vtexlocal.com.br/page-example/).

### Compress option

You can use the flag `--compress` to develop with minified files (JS, CSS, and SASS).

### Changing default port

You can easily change the proxy port by setting the PORT environment variable, e.g. `PORT=9000 npm start`

## FAQ

### What is `ECONNRESET`?

The HTTP response socket hung up before sending a complete reply.  
You probably manually stopped a request on your browser.  
Thus, the proxy shouted: "I was receiving a response and it stopped abruptly!"
